Write three styles of tutorial on Yak: a brief intro for someone not sure whether they want to learn it, a relaxed tutorial for someone who wants to learn it "in practice", and a complete for someone who wants rigor.

Allow <script type='text/yak'></script> tags. 

Create a Yak package on npm.

Give Yak a jQuery vocabulary.

Have all funjects (other than builtin types) carry an ID (not accessible to the programmer) so that they can be compared for equality.
    Now only Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Nil, Dot, Unknown, and Lists can be compared.

Fix errors
    They are currently very ad-hoc, look ugly, and provide no stack trace. We should also allow the user to throw their own errors.

Write library functions
    The user can now only add, multiply, and divide numbers. We still need to add map, string concatenation, JS style "apply", and others. We should also decide on a uniform naming scheme.
    
Consider adding a "Date" funject type

Consider adding class declarations or some form of prototypal inheritance. 
    Yak now has quite primitive prototypal inheritance:
        heir << inherited
    Makes inherited the parent funject of heir. When heir fails to match a pattern, the interpreter invokes inherited.
